                        <h2>About Me</h2>
                        <p>
                            Hello, my name is Andrae Taylor Jr. I am a 22-year-old senior college student currently attending Oakland University. I'm majoring in Information Technology, specializing in Cyber Security, and taking a minor in
                            the French Language. I come from Detroit, Michigan, and have lived here all my life. I would describe myself as very ambitious and hard-working, as I have a lot of goals I wish to achieve
                            in my personal and professional life.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My professional aspiration is to one day do cyber protection for some of the big companies like Google or Apple. As of current (2023), I have no affiliations or work background in the field but
                            am actively looking for internships to do to gain experience. In my personal time, I have a company where I do personal game-creation projects to sell those games. If possible
                            I would also like this company to become very successful and hopefully even get me into professional game development fields.
                        </p>
                        <p>If you'd like to learn more about me, look at my <a href="./html/resume.html">resume</a> and <a href="./html/funFacts.html">fun facts</a> about me!</p>
